## Project Overview
• Created a model that estimates Data Sciencent's salary, that helps Data Scientist's negotiate their income when they get a job.
• Engineered features from the text of each job description to quantify the value companies put on python, excel, aws, and spark.
• Optimized Linear, Lasso, Ridge, and Random Forest regressors using GridsearchCV to reach the best model.

## Resources Used
• Packages: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn.
• Dataset by **Ken Jee**: https://github.com/PlayingNumbers/ds_salary_proj

## Data Cleaning

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Feature Engineering
• Transformed the categorical variables into dummy variables
• Split the data into train and tests sets with a test size of 20%

## Model Building
Algorithms used for this project are as follows:
• Multiple Linear Regression
• Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization)
• Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization)
• Random Forest

## Model Evaluation
I have used Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as the evaluation metric, and here are the scores:
• Multiple Linear Regression -  
• Lasso Regression (L1 Regularization) - 
• Ridge Regression (L2 Regularization) - 
• Random Forest -
